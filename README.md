## üß† Project Overview

**MyGpt** is an experimental AI chatbot designed to simulate natural conversations between humans and machines. It processes user inputs, generates contextually relevant responses, and provides a modular framework for integrating advanced AI models. Built as a learning project, it showcases the integration of frontend, backend, and AI logic in a cohesive application.

This project is ideal for:
- **Students** learning AI, NLP, or full-stack web development  
- **Developers** exploring conversational AI and API integrations  
- **Hobbyists** looking to deploy their own chatbot locally or in the cloud

## üí° Motivation

The goal of **MyGpt** was to build a simplified version of ChatGPT from scratch to deepen my understanding of:
- How conversational AI systems process and respond to user inputs  
- How to integrate backend logic with a dynamic frontend  
- How to manage real-time chat interactions and conversation history  

By creating **MyGpt**, I explored:
- Prompt parsing and response generation  
- Modular AI logic (rule-based or API-driven)  
- Seamless integration with external NLP APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)  
- Building a scalable and user-friendly web application
